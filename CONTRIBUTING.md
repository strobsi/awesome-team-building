This resource was made by remote companies and wouldn't be possible without you! We appreciate and recognize [all contributors](https://github.com/strobsi/awesome-team-building/graphs/contributors).

# Contribution Guidelines

> Please be aware that we want to accept your contribution, but we have **some rules to keep the minimum quality** of the packages listed here. All reviews are **not personal feedback**, even if you are a _developer reviewing your contribution_. **Sorry if we can't meet your expectations, we do our best**.

- **To add, remove, or change things on the list:** Submit a pull request

- List items should be sorted _alphabetically_;
- Each item should be limited to one link;
- The link should be the name of the package or project;
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional;
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line and end with a punctuation mark;
- At least 3 items are needed to create a new category;
- The package or project had to be maintained under **open source license** ( _we make a brief review of the code before the link enters the list_ ), [see list of allowed licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical).

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.

If you removed our PR template you can find it [here](https://github.com/strobsi/awesome-team-building/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Quality standards

- Code functions as documented and expected
- Generally useful to the wider community of remote companies
- Actively maintained
- Stable or progressing toward stable
- Thoroughly documented, so everyone is able to understand the project's intention and how it works

## Reporting issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes packages fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or let us know. We also realize that sometimes projects are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature. These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days). This grace window benefits projects that may be going through a temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.

Thanks everyone!
