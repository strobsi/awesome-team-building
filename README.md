## Get To Know's

_Games, where you can get to know new employees_

- [2-lies-one-truth]() - All participants invent two lies about themselves and one truth, which also seems like a lie. The group can then guess, which is what. `We just used to ask our team within our communication channels -> then created some slides out of it and guessed.`

## Drawing

_Games, where you or the whole group draws_

- [GarticPhone](https://garticphone.com/de) - The participants create a sentence, which has to be drawn by the others and vice versa.
- [Scribbl](https://skribbl.io/) - One player tries to sketch up some word/sentence. The others have to guess.

## Puzzles

- [StadtLandFluss](https://stadtlandfluss.cool/#) - The classic. Online.

## Games

- [Among Us](https://www.epicgames.com/store/de/p/among-us) - Either iOS or Android - best with digital meetup in parallel
- [SecretHitler](https://secret-hitler.com/) - Just like werewolf, but with Hitler.
