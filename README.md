A curated list of awesome team building online games

### [2-lies-one-truth]()

All participants invent two lies about themselves and one truth, which also seems like a lie. The group can then guess, which is what.

`We just used to ask our team within our communication channels -> then created some slides out of it and guessed.`

### [GarticPhone](https://garticphone.com/de)

Game, where the participants create a sentence, which has to be drawn by the others and vice versa.

### [StadtLandFluss](https://stadtlandfluss.cool/#)

The classic. Online.

### [Scribbl](https://skribbl.io/)

Game, where one player tries to sketch up some word/sentence. The others have to guess.

### [Among Us]()

Nice to play having a digital meetup in parallel.
